PrepPal - Project Features
=============================

Core Objectives
---------------
The Meal Prep App is a **mobile application** designed to simplify meal planning and recipe management. It focuses on:

* **Personal recipe storage** (no social/sharing features)
* **Streamlined user experience** with minimal complexity
* **Basic account management** without password requirements

Included Features
----------------

Account System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ✔️ Email + username login (no password storage)
* ✔️ Unique username validation
* ✔️ Session management (login/logout)

Recipe Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ✔️ Create recipes with:
  - Name & description
  - Ingredients (free-text input)
  - Instructions (single text field)
  - Estimated preparation time
* ✔️ Delete recipes (no confirmation pop-up)

User Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ✔️ Minimalist design
* ✔️ Consistent layout and color scheme
* ✔️ Intuitive navigation


Rationale for Scope
-------------------
The team prioritized **core functionality** (account + recipe management) over complex features due to:

1. **Time constraints**
2. **Technical complexity** (e.g., password security, image moderation)
3. **User experience focus** (avoiding clutter)

Future Expansion
----------------
Features like meal planning calendars or grocery lists may be added post-MVP.
